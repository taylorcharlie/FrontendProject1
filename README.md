# FrontendProject1
This repository will include my folder and files of my first front end website build, in the folder project1 you will find everything you need to see the website that i coded and created myself.
To view the website please download the files and select and right click index.html. This should bring up a list which you now would need to click open with...google chrome.
I created this website with help from a free course tutorial from Bring Your Own Laptop/Dan, Link to his website:https://bringyourownlaptop.com/
